# Python_Project_Portfolio
Hello!
This is a collection of a projects that I have created myself to practice various Python concepts.
Feel free to let me know of any ways to improve my code. I am very open to criticism and learning. 

I have created a Discord Bot that is themed after the Dragon Quest Slime monster that can also play music. Automoderation features will be added later on.
I have created a meal display that will prompt the user for input on what type of protein they would like in their meal, then call to the beef, chicken, or fish txt files for the recipes.
I have created a dice roll simulation by using random, as well as a rock paper scissors game that keeps score.
I have created a very rough twitch revenue calculator based off subscriptions and if they are reoccurring.
I have also created a very simple Youtube video downloader.

I have many more projects to come
